# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project uses Excel to analyze how different kinds of Kickstarter projects fared when comparing them to their launch dates and funsing goals.
### Purpose
The purpose is to identify trends in the success rate of kickstarter campaigns for plays based on factors like the funding goal and launch date.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis was performed using pivot tables and pivot charts.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis was performed using the countifs function and Excel charts.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One issue I ran into was the title for my pivot chart. While researching, I discovered there is a known bug that causes titles not to show up on Macs when using pivot charts specifically. I solved this by manually creating a text box over the chart to house my title.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The first conclusion I can draw is that plays launched in late spring or early summer fare better than their peers. The second conclusion I can draw is that December is the worst month to launch a play.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I found that keeping the funding goals lower greatly impacts the feasability of the projects reaching their goal.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One limitation is that a vast majority of the data is US based.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could look at the success rate of plays versus other types of campaigns that were launched.
